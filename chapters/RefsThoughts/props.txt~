By studying geometry we seek to discover the figures that can be
obtained given a set of rules. 

Figures are composed of lines and points.



Proof By Picture

Anatomy
-lines
-circles
-break polys into triangles (TA)

Compass
-Constructions
-Tricker Constructions
-constructible numbers (beginning)

Origami
-Constructons
-Tricker Constructions
-constructible numbers (beginning)

Coordinate
-Constructions
-Constructible numbers
-Impossibilites

Taxicab
-constructions
-conic sections
-getting work done

Transformations

Theory of parallels could be acheived by discussing
hyperbolic/spherical geometry.


Chapters/Handouts:

Anatomy of Triangles
TA Median etc etc
TA Euler Line (DO IT JUSTICE)
Compass and Strightedge Constructions








1. Constructing an equilateral triangle on a given segment. 
2. SAS - EP4
3. EP5 -- interested in this.....
4. EP6 -- not used 
5


Similarity needs to be addressed -- could this be addressed in
transformations?



Rules for construction vs axioms for verification.

Dfns - redefine definition per section. each time they will get more precise. 

Can you use origami to solve constructions from Ideas in Geometry?



Origami
