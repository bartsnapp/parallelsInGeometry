Transform:
=======================
ADD SIMILAR FIGURE SECTION WITH SCALING!!!!
Herb's questions from 507--getting at the group structure
-- flip a parabola around find vertex etc..
Constructions. "what is a line"? etc


ADD: illustration for geometric transformation!


Add: Take a point relfect, translate, rotate,
write a single expression with F, T, R that represents the blah

CHECK GEOMETRIC TRANSFORMATION!!!!!
why are they ALL true!? ALSO CHECK BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER!!!!!!

matrices that tesselate a figure

rotate around a pt not the origin.


Random:
===============
Why is Pi unique?



City:
====================================

classify the parabolas/midsets as an aid for drawing them
(why do we classify things!)


see:

http://www.mathematische-basteleien.de/taxicabgeometry.htm


Coordinate:
==========================

Add eg to coordinate constructions--the students need to be shown what
is expected of them there. (level of rigor/explanation etc)


Maybe loose the D (descartes numbers) stuff.
Just say:

C is the set of compass and straightedge constructible numbers. Note
that this is \textbf{the same} as the set of numbers constructible via
coordiante consturctions.

\item\label{P:COORD:Ri} The complex numbers $\C$ can be expressed as follows: 
\[ \C = \R(i) =
\{a + b i: a,b\in \R \} 
\] 
Can you devise a similar way of expressing $\Q(\sqrt{2})$? Explain
your reasoning.

\item Considering Problem~\ref{P:COORD:Ri}, can you devise a similar
way of expressing $\Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$? Explain your reasoning.

DUPLICATE COMPLEX NUMBER STUFF!!!!
(rationalize denominator)


How does $\Q(\sqrt{6})$ compare with $\Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$

Are the questions: Is \sqrt{7} rational, is it constructible? Good?


List all constructible regular n-gons with n from 1 to 100.

=============================================
TAKE HOME is gunked up.  
since the apothem is 1, the sidelengths and constructed lengths are
actually fixed.... Possible fix: 

Considering that the apothem is 1, what is a resonable estimate for
$\l$? In this case what is $d$? What does this say about the
correctness/accuracy of this construction?


===================================
Lesson Plan: Area & Perimeter




Set Theory: 
=============================================
count number of sections in venn diagrams produce venn
diagram for 4 sets



Tessellations:
===================================
FIX CHART PROBLEM.

ANGLE(S) TOO VAGUE
ANOTHER SLOT FOR PRODUCT OF # AROUND EACH VERTEX AND ANGLE!

=====================================

Compass:
=========================================
FOR THE CHALLENGE CONST, COULD YOU SUGGEST THAT YOU START WITH A TRI
AND MEASURE TO GET PARTS THAT WORK?

for parallel through a point, maybe make tops of isosceles cross???

Given an isoceles triangle, prove that the angle bisector
perpendicularly bisects the opposite side.



perimeter and area / talk to Betsy



Origami:
=========================================
Simiar figures SCALE!!!
Remove dfn on equal angles
restate SAS-Sim to state that triangles have congruent angles.

3.3 #7 - does it need to be right? If not then what?



See Hartshorne's Book: Geometry: Euclid and Beyond. for similar triangle!!!



TV Qs: A HDTV has an aspect ratio of $16:9$. On the other hand, the
size of a TV is given by its diagonal. What are the dimentions of the
following TV's?

*13"
*24"
*33"
*42"
*50"

Regular TV $4:3$, CHECK IMAX

Is an IMAX closer to a HDTV or a traditional TV?



FOR SEMESTER CONVERSION - 
ADD SOLIDS SECTION


Laying down stair case 
code for steps, 3/8th difference. Roof line. etc

some thought will be needed here!!!

OK MAYBE A SEQUENCE:


-- the first one should be totally doable.  can be done with
-- side-splitting, or through simple similar triangle reasoning.
