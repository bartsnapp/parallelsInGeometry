\section{Welcome to the City}


One day I was walking through the city---that's right, New York City. I
had the most terrible feeling that I was lost. I had just passed a
\textit{Starbucks Coffee} on my left and a \textit{Sbarro Pizza} on my
right, when what did I see? Another \textit{Starbucks Coffee} and
\textit{Sbarro Pizza}! Three options occurred to me:
\begin{enumerate}
\item I was walking in circles.
\item I was at the nexus of the universe.\index{nexus of the universe}
\item New York City had way too many \textit{Starbucks} and \textit{Sbarro Pizzas}!
\end{enumerate}
Regardless, I was lost. My buddy Joe came to my rescue. He pointed out that the city is organized like a grid. 

``Ah! city geometry!'' I exclaimed.\index{city geometry}\index{geometry!City} At this point all Joe could say was
``Huh?''


\begin{ques} What the heck was I talking about?
\end{ques}

Let me tell you: \textit{Euclidean geometry}\index{geometry!Euclidean}
is regular old plane (not plain!) geometry. It is the geometry that
we've been exploring thus far in our journey.  In \textit{city
  geometry} we have points and lines, just like in Euclidean geometry.
However, most cities can be viewed as a grid of city blocks
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/citygrid.pdf}
\]
and when we travel in a city, we can only travel on the streets---we
can't cut through the blocks. This means that we don't measure
distance as the crow flies. Instead we use the \textit{taxicab
  distance}:

\begin{dfn}\index{taxicab distance}\index{d@$d$!taxicab}\index{distance!taxicab}Given two points $A = (a_x,a_y)$ and $B = (b_x,b_y)$, we define the
\textbf{taxicab distance} as:
\[
d_T(A,B) = |a_x - b_x| + |a_y - b_y|
\]
\end{dfn}


\begin{eg} Consider the following points:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/citygrideg1.pdf}
\]
Let $A = (0,0)$. Now we see that $B = (7,4)$. Hence
\begin{align*}
d_T(A,B) &= |0 - 7| + |0-4|\\
&= 7 + 4 \\
&= 11.
\end{align*}
Of course in real life, you would want to add in the appropriate units
to your final answer.
\end{eg}

\begin{ques} How do you compute the distance between $A$ and $B$ as the crow flies?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{dfn}\index{city geometry}\index{geometry!city}
The geometry where points and lines are those from Euclidean geometry
but distance is measured via taxicab distance is called \textbf{city
  geometry}.
\end{dfn}

\begin{ques} Compare and contrast the notion of a line in Euclidean geometry and in city geometry. In either geometry is a line the unique shortest path between any two points?
\end{ques}
\QM



\subsection{(Un)Common Structures}

How different is life in city geometry from life in Euclidean
geometry? Let's find out!

\subsubsection{Triangles}

If we think back to Euclidean geometry, we
may recall some lengthy discussions on triangles. Yet so far, we have
not really discussed triangles in city geometry.

\begin{ques} What does a triangle look like in city geometry and how do you measure its angles? \index{city geometry!triangle}\index{triangle!city geometry}
\end{ques}

I'll take this one. Triangles look the same in city geometry as they
do in Euclidean geometry. Also, you measure angles in exactly the same
way. However, there is one minor hiccup. Consider these two triangles
in city geometry:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/citytri.pdf}
\]
\begin{ques} 
What are the lengths of the sides of each of these triangles? Why is
this odd?
\end{ques}
\QM 

Hence we see that triangles are a bit funny in city geometry.

\subsubsection{Circles}

Circles are also discussed in many geometry courses and this course is
no different. However, in city geometry the circles are a little less
round. The first question we must answer is the following:

\begin{ques} What is a circle?
\end{ques}

Well, a circle is the collection of all points equidistant from a
given point. So in city geometry, we must conclude that a circle of
radius $2$ would look like:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/citycircle.pdf}
\]
\index{circle!city geometry}\index{city geometry!circle}
\begin{ques} What sort of shape should a city geometry compass draw?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} 
How many points are there at the intersection of two circles in
Euclidean geometry? How many points are there at the intersection of
two circles in city geometry?
\end{ques}
\QM

\subsection*{Problems for Section~\thesection}\hrule\vspace{1ex}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given two points $A$ and $B$ in city geometry, does $d_T(A,B) =
  d_T(B,A)$? Explain your reasoning.
\item It was once believed that Euclid's five postulates
\begin{enumerate}
\item A line can be drawn from a point to any other point.
\item A finite line can be extended indefinitely.
\item A circle can be drawn, given a center and a radius.
\item All right angles are ninety degrees. 
\item If a line intersects two other lines such that the sum of the
  interior angles on one side of the intersecting line is less than
  the sum of two right angles, then the lines meet on that side and
  not on the other side.
\end{enumerate}
were sufficient to completely describe plane geometry.  Explain how
city geometry shows that Euclid's five postulates are \textbf{not}
enough to determine all of the familiar properties of the plane.

\item In Euclidean geometry are all equilateral triangles congruent
  assuming they have the same side length? Is this true in city
  geometry? Explain your reasoning.

\item How many points are there at the intersection of two circles in
  Euclidean geometry? How many points are there at the intersection of
  two circles in city geometry? Explain your reasoning.

\section{Anatomy of Figures and the City}

When we study geometry, what do we seek? That's right---we wish to
discover the points that can be obtained given a set of rules. With
city geometry, the major rule involved is the taxicab distance. Let's
answer these questions!

\begin{ques} 
In regards to city geometry, what is a \textit{point}?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques}
In regards to city geometry, what is a \textit{line}?
\end{ques}
\QM


\begin{ques}
In regards to city geometry, what is a \textit{circle}?
\end{ques}
\QM


Now I'm going to quiz you about them (I know we've already gone over
this \textit{twice}, but it is fundamental so just smile and answer
the questions):

\begin{ques} 
Place two points randomly in the plane. Do you expect to be able to
draw a single line that connects them?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} 
Place three points randomly in the plane. Do you expect to be able to
draw a single line that connects them?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} 
Place two lines randomly in the plane. How many points do you expect
them to share?
\end{ques}
\QM


\begin{ques} 
Place three lines randomly in the plane. How many points do you expect
all three lines to share?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} 
Place three points randomly in the plane. Will you (almost!) always be
able to draw a city geometry circle containing these points? If no,
why not? If yes, how do you know?
\end{ques}
\QM



\subsubsection{Midsets}



\index{city geometry!midset}\index{midset!city geometry}
\begin{dfn}
Given two points $A$ and $B$, their \textbf{midset} is the set of points that are an equal distance away from both $A$ and $B$.
\end{dfn}
\begin{ques}
How do we find the midset of two points in Euclidean geometry? How do we find the midset of two points in city geometry?
\end{ques}
In Euclidean geometry, we just take the the following line:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/emidset.pdf}
\]
If we had no idea what the midset should look like in Euclidean
geometry, we could start as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw circles of radius $r_1$ centered at both $A$ and $B$. If these
circles intersect, then their points of intersection will be in our
midset. (Why?)

\item Draw circles of radius $r_2$ centered at both $A$ and $B$. If these
circles intersect, then their points of intersection will be in our
midset.

\item We continue in this fashion until we have a clear idea of what the
midset looks like. It is now easy to check that the line in our
picture is indeed the midset.
\end{itemize}

How do we do it in city geometry? We do it basically the same way.

\begin{eg} Suppose you wished to find the midset of two points in city geometry.

We start by fixing coordinate axes. Considering the diagram below, if
$A=(0,0)$, then $B=(5,3)$. We now use the same idea as in Euclidean
geometry. Drawing circles of radius $3$ centered at $A$ and $B$
respectively, we see that there are no points $3$ points away from
both $A$ and $B$. Since $d_T(A,B)=8$, this is to be expected. We will
need to draw larger taxicab circles before we will find points in the
midset. Drawing taxicab circles of radius $5$, we see that the points
$(1,4)$ and $(4,-1)$ are both in our midset.
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/cmidset.pdf}
\]
Now it is time to sing along. You draw circles of radius $6$, to get
two more points $(1,5)$ and $(4,-2)$. Drawing circles with larger
radii yields more and more points ``due north'' of $(1,5)$ and ``due
south'' of $(4,-2)$. However, if we draw circles of radius $4$
centered at $A$ and $B$ respectively, their intersection is the line
segment between $(1,3)$ and $(4,0)$. Unlike Euclidean circles,
distinct city geometry circles can intersect in more than two points and
city geometry midsets can be more complicated than their Euclidean
counterparts. 
\end{eg}

\begin{ques}How do you draw the city geometry midset of $A$ and
$B$? What could the midsets look like?
\end{ques}
\QM






\subsubsection{Parabolas}


Recall that a parabola is a set of points such that each of those
points is the same distance from a given point, $F$, as it is from a
given line, $D$. 
\[
\includegraphics[angle=90,scale=.4]{../graphics/parabolapointline.pdf}
\]
This definition still makes sense when we work with taxicab distance
instead of Euclidean distance. To start, choose a value $r$ and draw a
line parallel to $D$ at taxicab distance $r$ away from $D$. Now draw a
City circle of radius $r$ centered at $F$. The points of intersection
of this line and this circle will be $r$ away from $D$ and $r$ away
from $F$ and so will be points on our City parabola. Repeat this
process for different values of $r$. 
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/cparabola.pdf}
\]
\index{city geometry!parabola}\index{parabola!city geometry}

Unlike the Euclidean case, the City parabola need not grow broader and
broader as the distance from the line increases. In the picture above,
as we go from $A$ to $B$ on the parabola, both the taxicab and
Euclidean distances to the line $D$ increase by $1$. The taxicab
distance from the point $F$ also increases by $1$ as we go from $A$ to
$B$ but the Euclidean distance increases by less than $1$. For the
Euclidean distance from $F$ to the parabola to keep increasing at the
same rate as the distance to the line $D$, the Euclidean parabola has
to keep spreading to the sides.

\begin{ques}How do you draw city geometry parabolas? What do different parabolas look like?
\end{ques}
\QM



\subsubsection{A Paradox}

To be completely clear on what a paradox is, here is the definition we
will be using:
\begin{dfn}\index{paradox} A \textbf{paradox}\index{paradox} is a statement that seems to be contradictory. This means it seems both true and false at the same time. 
\end{dfn}

There are many paradoxes in mathematics. By studying them we gain
insight---and also practice tying our brain into knots! Here is a paradox:

\begin{para} $\sqrt{2} = 2$.\index{paradox!$\sqrt{2}=2$}\index{sqrt2@$\sqrt{2}$}
\end{para}

\begin{proof}[False-Proof] Consider the following sequence of diagrams:
\[
\includegraphics[width=4in]{../graphics/root2para.pdf}
\]
On the far right-hand side, we see a right-triangle. Suppose that the
lengths of the legs of the right-triangle are one. Now by the
Pythagorean Theorem, the length of the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{1^2+1^2}
=\sqrt{2}.$

However, we see that the triangles coming from the left converge to
the triangle on the right. In every case on the left, the stair-step
side has length $2$. Hence when our sequence of stair-step triangles
converges, we see that the hypotenuse of the right-triangle will have
length $2$. Thus $\sqrt{2} = 2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{ques} What is wrong with the proof above? 
\end{ques}
\QM

\subsection*{Problems for Section~\thesection}\hrule\vspace{1ex}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose that you have two triangles $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ in  city geometry such that

\section{Getting Work Done}

If you are interested in \textit{real-world} types of problems, then
maybe city geometry is the geometry for you. The concepts that arise
in city geometry are directly applicable to everyday life.

\begin{ques}
Will just bought himself a brand new gorilla suit.\index{gorilla suit}
He wants to show it off at three parties this Saturday night. The
parties are being held at his friends' houses: the
Antidisestablishment $(A)$, Hausdorff $(H)$, and the Wookie Loveshack
$(W)$. If he travels from party $A$ to party $H$ to party $W$, how far
does he travel this Saturday night?
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/citygrideg2.pdf}
\]
\end{ques} 
\begin{proof}[Solution] We need to compute
\[
d_T(A,H)+d_T(H,W)
\]
Let's start by fixing a coordinate system and making $A$ the
origin. Then $H$ is $(2,-5)$ and $W$ is $(-10,-2)$. Then
\begin{align*}
d_T(A,H) &=|0 - 2| + | 0 -(-5)|\\
&= 2+5\\
&=7
\end{align*}
 and 
\begin{align*}
d_T(H,W) &= | 2 - (-10) | + | -5 - (-2)|\\
&= 12 + 3 \\
&= 15.
\end{align*} 
Will must trudge $7+15 = 22$ blocks in his gorilla suit.
\end{proof}



Okay, that's enough monkey business---I feel like pizza and a movie.


\begin{ques}
Brad and Melissa are going to downtown Champaign, Illinois. Brad wants
to go to \textit{Jupiter's} for pizza $(J)$ while Melissa goes to
\textit{Boardman's Art Theater} $(B)$ to watch a movie. Where should
they park to minimize the total distance walked by both?
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/citygrideg3.pdf}
\]
\end{ques}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
Again, let's set up a coordinate system so that we can say what points
we are talking about. If $J$ is $(0,0)$, then $B$ is $(-5,4)$.
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/citygrideg4.pdf}
\]
No matter where they park, Brad and Melissa's two paths joined
together must make a path from $B$ to $J$. This combined path has to
be at least $9$ blocks long since $d_T(B,J)=9$. They should look for a
parking spot in the rectangle formed by the points
$(0,0),(0,4),(-5,0)$, and $(-5,4)$.

Suppose they park within this rectangle and call this point
$C$. Melissa now walks $4$ blocks from $C$ to $B$ and Brad walks $5$
blocks from $C$ to $J$. The two paths joined together form a path from
$B$ to $J$ of length $9$.

If they park outside the rectangle described above, for example at
point $D$, then the corresponding path from $B$ to $J$ will be longer
than $9$ blocks. Any path from $B$ to $J$ going through $D$ goes a
block too far west and then has to backtrack a block to the east
making it longer than $9$ blocks.
\end{proof}
\begin{ques}
If we consider the same question in Euclidean geometry, what is the
answer?
\end{ques}
\QM


\begin{ques}
Tom is looking for an apartment that is close to Altgeld Hall $(H)$
but is also close to his favorite restaurant, \textit{Crane
  Alley}\index{Crane Alley} $(C)$. Where should Tom live?
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/citygrideg6.pdf}
\]
\end{ques}
\begin{proof}[Solution]
If we fix a coordinate system with its origin at Altgeld Hall, $H$,
then $C$ is at $(8,2)$. We see that $d_T(H,C)=10$. If Tom wants to
live as close as possible to both of these, he should look for an
apartment, $A$, such that $d_T(A,H)=d_T(A,C)=5$. He would then be
living halfway along one of the shortest paths from Altgeld to the
restaurant. Mark all the points $5$ blocks away from $H$. Now mark all
the points $5$ blocks away from $C$.
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/citygrideg7.pdf}
\]
We now see that Tom should check out the apartments near $(5,0), (4,1)$, and $(3,2)$.
\end{proof}
