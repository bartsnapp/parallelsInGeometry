\section{Constructions}

While origami as an art form is quite ancient, folding and tracing constructions
in mathematics are relatively new. The earliest mathematical
discussion of folding and tracing constructions that I know of appears in
T.\ Sundara Row's book \textit{Geometric Exercises in Paper Folding},
\cite{row}, first published near the end of the Nineteenth Century. In
the Twentieth Century it was shown that every construction that is
possible with a compass and straightedge can be done with
folding and tracing. Moreover, there are constructions that are possible via
folding and tracing that are \textit{impossible} with compass and straightedge
alone. This may seem strange as you can draw a circle with a compass,
yet this seems impossible to do via paper-folding. We will address
this issue in due time. Let's get down to business---here are the
rules of folding and tracing constructions:


\subsubsection*{Rules for Folding and Tracing Constructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You may only use folds, a marker, and semi-transparent paper.
\item Points can only be placed in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item As the intersection of two lines. 
\item By marking ``through'' folded paper onto a previously placed
  point. Think of this as when the ink from a permanent marker
  ``bleeds'' through the paper.
\end{enumerate}
\item Lines can only be obtained in three ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item By joining two points---either with a drawn line or a fold.
\item As a crease created by a fold. 
\item By marking ``through'' folded paper onto a previously placed
  line.
\end{enumerate}
\item One can only fold the paper when:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Matching up points with points.
\item Matching up a line with a line.
\item Matching up two points with two intersecting lines.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


Now we are going to present several basic constructions. Compare these
to the ones done with a compass and straightedge. We will proceed by
the order of difficulty of the construction.


\begin{con}[Transferring a Segment]\index{folding and tracing!transferring a segment}  
Given a segment, we wish to move it so that it starts on a given
point, on a given line.
\end{con}


\begin{con}[Copying an Angle]\index{folding and tracing!copying an angle} 
Given a point on a line and some angle, we wish to copy the given
angle so that the new angle has the point as its vertex and the line
as one of its edges.
\end{con}

Transferring segments and copying angles using folding and tracing without a
``bleeding marker'' can be tedious. Here is an easy way to do it: 
\begin{center}
\textbf{Use 2 sheets of paper and a pen that will mark through multiple
sheets.}
\end{center}

\begin{ques} 
Can you find a way to do the above constructions without using a
marker whose ink will pass through paper?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{con}[Bisecting a Segment]\index{folding and tracing!bisecting a segment} 
Given a segment, we wish to cut it in half.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fold the paper so that the endpoints of the segment meet.
\item The crease will bisect the given segment.
\end{enumerate}
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/origamiBisect.pdf}
\]
\end{con}

\begin{ques} 
Which rule for folding and tracing constructions are we using above?
\end{ques}
\QM


\begin{con}[Perpendicular through a Point]\index{folding and tracing!perpendicular through a point}  
Given a point and a line, we wish to construct a line perpendicular to
the original line that passes through the given point.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fold the given line onto itself so that the crease passes though
  the given point.
\item The crease will be the perpendicular line.
\end{enumerate}
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/origamiPerpPoint.pdf}
\]
\end{con}

\begin{ques} Which rule for folding and tracing constructions are we using above?
\end{ques}
\QM




\begin{con}[Bisecting an Angle]\index{folding and tracing!bisecting an angle} 
We wish to divide an angle in half.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fold a point on one leg of the angle to the other leg so that
  the crease passes though the vertex of the angle.
\item The crease will bisect the angle.
\end{enumerate}
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/origamiBangle.pdf}
\]
\end{con}


\begin{ques} Which rule for folding and tracing constructions are we using above?
\end{ques}
\QM



\begin{con}[Parallel through a Point]\index{folding and tracing!parallel through a point} 
 Given a line and a point, we wish to construct another line parallel
 to the first that passes through the given point.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fold a perpendicular line through the given point.
\item Fold a line perpendicular to this new line through the given
  point.
\end{enumerate}
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/origamiParaPoint.pdf}
\]
\end{con}



Now there may be a pressing question in your head:

\begin{ques} 
How the heck are we going to fold a circle?
\end{ques}

First of all, remember the definition of a circle:

\begin{dfn}\index{circle}
A \textbf{circle} is the set of points that are a fixed distance from
a given point.
\end{dfn}

\begin{ques} Is the center of a circle part of the circle?
\end{ques}
\QM

Secondly, remember that when doing compass and straightedge
constructions we can \textbf{only} mark points that are intersections
of lines and lines, lines and circles, and circles and circles. Thus
while we technically draw circles, we can only actually mark certain
points on circles.  When it comes to folding and tracing constructions, drawing a
circle amounts to marking points a given distance away from a given
point---that is exactly what we can do with compass and straightedge
constructions.


\begin{con}[Intersection of a Line and a Circle]
\index{folding and tracing!intersection of a line and a circle} We wish to
construct the points where a given line meets a given circle. Note: A
circle is given by a point on the circle and the central point.
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Fold the point on the circle onto the given line so that the
  crease passes through the center of the circle.
\item Mark this point though both sheets of paper onto the line.
\end{enumerate}
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/origamiCircLine.pdf}
\]
\end{con}

\begin{ques} Which rule for folding and tracing constructions are we using above?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} How could you check that your folding and tracing construction is correct?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{con}[Equilateral Triangle]\index{folding and tracing!equilateral triangle} 
We wish to construct an equilateral triangle given the length of one
side.
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Bisect the segment.
\item Fold one end of the segment onto the bisector so that the crease
  passes through the other end of the segment. Mark this point onto
  the bisector.
\item Connect the points.
\end{enumerate}
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/origamiTriangle.pdf}
\]
\end{con}

\begin{ques} Which rules for folding and tracing constructions are we using above?
\end{ques}
\QM







\begin{con}[Intersection of Two Circles]\index{folding and tracing!intersection of two circles} 
We with to intersect two circles, each given by a center point and a
point on the circle. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use four sheets of tracing paper. On the first sheet, mark the
  centers of both circles. On the next two sheets, mark the center and
  point on each of the circle---one circle per sheet. 
\item Simply move the two sheets with the centers and points on the
  circles, so that the centers are over the centers from the first
  sheet, and the points on the circles coincide. Now on the fourth
  sheet, mark all points.
\end{enumerate}
\end{con}
\QM


Think about the definition of a circle. In a similar fashion we can
define other common geometric figures:


\begin{dfn} 
Given a point and a line, a \textbf{parabola}\index{parabola} is the
set of points such that each of these points is the same distance from
the given point as it is from the given line.
\[
\includegraphics[angle=90,scale=.4]{../graphics/parabolapointline.pdf}
\]
\end{dfn}

We can also form a parabola from an \textit{envelope of
  tangents}:\index{envelope of tangents}
\[
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{../graphics/envelope.pdf}
\]
Using a similar idea we can essentially obtain a parabola using
folding and tracing.

\begin{con}[Parabola]\index{folding and tracing!parabola} 
Given a point and a line we wish to construct a parabola.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a series of equally spaced marks on your line. 
\item Fold the point onto the marks.
\item Repeat the above step until an envelope of tangents forms.
\end{enumerate}
\end{con}

\begin{ques} 
Considering the definition of the parabola, can you explain why the
above construction makes sense?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} Can you give a compass and straightedge construction of a parabola?
\end{ques}
\QM

Our final basic folding and tracing construction is one that \textbf{cannot} be
done with compass and straightedge alone.



\begin{con}[Angle Trisection\footnote{This construction was discovered by S.T.\ Gormsen and verified by S.H.\ Kung.}]\index{trisecting the angle}\index{folding and tracing!trisecting the angle}
We wish to divide an angle into thirds.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Bisect the given angle.
\item Find two points (one on each leg of the angle) equidistant from the vertex of the angle.
\item Fold the two points found above so that one of them lands on the
  extension (behind the angle) of the angle bisector and one lands on
  the line containing the other leg of the triangle---this will be
  behind the vertex. You are basically folding the angle back over
  itself.
\item The crease from the last step will intersect the angle bisector
  at some point, mark it.
\item The angle with the above mark as its vertex, the bisector found
  above as one of its legs, and the line to either of the points found
  in step 2 above will be one third of the starting angle.
\end{enumerate}
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/origamiTrisection.pdf}
\]
\end{con}

\section{Anatomy of Figures Redux}


Remember, in studying geometry we seek to discover the points that can
be obtained given a set of rules. Now the set of rules consists of the
rules for folding and tracing constructions.

\begin{ques} 
In regards to folding and tracing constructions, what is a \textit{point}?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques}
In regards to folding and tracing constructions, what is a \textit{line}?
\end{ques}
\QM


\begin{ques}
In regards to folding and tracing constructions, what is a \textit{circle}?
\end{ques}
\QM


OK, those are our basic figures, pretty easy right? Now I'm going to
quiz you about them (I know we've already gone over this, but it is
fundamental so just smile and answer the questions):

\begin{ques} 
Place two points randomly in the plane. Do you expect to be able to
draw a single line that connects them?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} 
Place three points randomly in the plane. Do you expect to be able to
draw a single line that connects them?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} 
Place two lines randomly in the plane. How many points do you expect
them to share?
\end{ques}
\QM


\begin{ques} 
Place three lines randomly in the plane. How many points do you expect
all three lines to share?
\end{ques}
\QM


\begin{ques} 
Place three points randomly in the plane. Will you (almost!) always be
able to draw a circle containing these points? If no, why not? If yes,
how do you know?
\end{ques}

\section{Similar Triangles}


In geometry, we may have several different segments all with the same
length. We don't want to say that the segments are \textit{equal}
because that would mean that they are \textit{exactly} the
same---position included. Hence we need a new concept:

\begin{dfn}\index{congruent!segments}
When different segments have the same length, we say they are
\textbf{congruent segments}. 
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}\index{congruent!angles}
In a similar fashion, if different angles have the same measure, we
say they are \textbf{congruent angles}.
\end{dfn}

Put these together and we have the definition for triangles:

\begin{dfn}\index{congruent!triangles} 
Two triangles are said to be \textbf{congruent triangles} if they have
the same side lengths and same angle measures.
\end{dfn}

After working with triangles for short time, one quickly sees that the
notion of congruence is not the only ``equivalence'' one wants to
make between triangles. In particular, we want the notion of
\textit{similarity.} \index{similar triangles}

One day when aloof old Professor Rufus was trying to explain similar
triangles to his class, he merely wrote
\[
\tri ABC \sim \tri A'B'C' \qquad\Leftrightarrow \qquad\begin{array}{l}
\angle A \simeq \angle A'\\
\angle B \simeq \angle B' \\
\angle C \simeq \angle C'
\end{array}
\]
and walked out of the room.

Can you give $3$ much needed examples of similar triangles?

\begin{ques} 
Devise a way to use folding and tracing constructions to help explore this notion
of similar triangles.

Another day when aloof old Professor Rufus was trying to explain
similar triangles to his class, he merely wrote
\[
\tri ABC \sim \tri A'B'C' \qquad\Leftrightarrow \qquad
\begin{array}{l}
AB = k\cdot A'B'\\
BC = k\cdot B'C' \\
CA = k\cdot C'A'

\subsection{Theorems for Similar Triangles}

In this section we will show that that \textbf{both} definitions of similar
triangles given above are \textbf{equivalent}.  We'll start with a gentle
question:

\begin{ques} What is the formula for the area of a triangle?
\end{ques}
\QM

Using merely the formula for the area of a triangle, we (meaning you)
will explain why the following important theorem is true. Note,
throughout this discussion we will use the convention that when we
write $AB$ we mean the \textit{length} of the segment $AB$.


\begin{thm}[Parallel-Side] 
\index{Parallel-Side Theorem}\index{Theorem!Parallel-Side}
Given:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/split1.pdf}
\]
If side $BC$ is parallel to side $DE$, then
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{AC}{AE}.
\] 
\end{thm}

\begin{ques}
Can you tell me in English what this theorem says? Provide some
examples of this theorem in action.
\end{ques}
\QM

Now we (meaning you) are going to explore a bit. See if answering
these questions sheds light on this.

\begin{ques} 
If $h$ is the height of $\tri ABC$, find a formula for the areas of
$\tri ABC$ and $\tri ADC$.
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/split2.pdf} \qquad \includegraphics{../graphics/split3.pdf}
\]
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} 
If $g$ is the height of $\tri ACB$, find a formula for the areas of
$\tri ACB$ and $\tri AEB$.
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/split4.pdf} \qquad \includegraphics{../graphics/split5.pdf}
\]
\end{ques}
\QM


\begin{ques} Explain why 
\[
\mathrm{Area}(\tri ABC) = \mathrm{Area}(\tri ACB).
\]
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} Explain why 
\[
\mathrm{Area}(\tri CBE) = \mathrm{Area}(\tri CBD).
\]
Big hint: Use the fact that you have two parallel sides! Draw a
picture to help clarify your explanation.
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} Explain why 
\[
\mathrm{Area}(\tri ADC)= \mathrm{Area}(\tri AEB).
\]
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques}
Explain why
\[
\frac{\mathrm{Area}(\tri ABC)}{\mathrm{Area}(\tri ADC)} = \frac{ \mathrm{Area}(\tri ACB)}{\mathrm{Area}(\tri AEB)}
\]
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} Compute and simplify both of the following expressions:
\[
\frac{\mathrm{Area}(\tri ABC)}{\mathrm{Area}(\tri ADC)} \qquad\text{and}\qquad\frac{ \mathrm{Area}(\tri ACB)}{\mathrm{Area}(\tri AEB)}
\]
\end{ques}
\QM


\begin{ques} How can you conclude that: 
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{AC}{AE}
\]
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} 
Why is it important that line $DE$ is parallel to line $CB$?
\end{ques}
\QM


\begin{ques} 
Can you sketch out (in words) how the questions above prove the Parallel-Side
Theorem?
\end{ques}
\QM

Now comes the moment of truth. 
\begin{ques}
Can you use the Parallel-Side Theorem to explain why if you know that
if you have two triangles, $\tri ABC$ and $\tri A'B'C'$ with:
\begin{align*}
\angle A &\simeq \angle A'\\
\angle B &\simeq \angle B' \\
\angle C &\simeq \angle C'
\end{align*}
then we must have that
\begin{align*}
AB &= k\cdot A'B'\\
BC &= k\cdot B'C'\\
CA &= k\cdot C'A'
\end{align*}
\end{ques}
\QM






\subsubsection{The Converse}

The converse of the Parallel-Side Theorem states:

\begin{thm}[Split-Side]\index{Split-Side Theorem}\index{Theorem!Split-Side} 
Given:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/split1.pdf}
\]
If side $BC$ intersects (splits) the sides of $\tri ADE$ so that
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{AC}{AE},
\] 
then side $BC$ is parallel to side $DE$.
\end{thm}

\begin{ques} 
How could you investigate this theorem using any of the construction
techniques above?
\end{ques}
\QM

Now we (meaning you) will answer questions in the hope that they will
help us see why the above theorem is true.

\begin{ques}
Suppose that you \textbf{doubt} that side $BC$ is parallel to side $DE$. Explain
how to place a point $C'$ on side $AE$ so that side $BC'$ is
parallel to line $DE$. Be sure to sketch the situation(s).
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} 
You now have a triangle $\tri ADE$ whose sides are split by a line
$BC'$ such that the line $BC'$ is parallel to line $DE$. What does the
Parallel-Side Theorem have to say about this?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} What can you conclude about points $C$ and $C'$?
\end{ques}
\QM


\begin{ques} 
What does this tell you about the Split-Side Theorem?
\end{ques}
\QM




Let's see if you can put this all together:
\begin{ques}
Can you use the Split-Side Theorem to explain why if you know that
if you have two triangles, $\tri ABC$ and $\tri A'B'C'$ with:
\begin{align*}
AB &= k\cdot A'B'\\
BC &= k\cdot B'C'\\
CA &= k\cdot C'A'
\end{align*}
then we must have that
\begin{align*}
\angle A &\simeq \angle A'\\
\angle B &\simeq \angle B' \\
\angle C &\simeq \angle C'
\end{align*}
\end{ques}
\QM

Putting all of our work above together, we may now say the following:





\begin{dfn}\index{similar triangles} 
Two triangles $\tri ABC$ and $\tri A'B'C'$ are said to be
\textbf{similar} if either equilvalent condition holds:
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\angle A \simeq \angle A'\\
\angle B \simeq \angle B' \\
\angle C \simeq \angle C'
\end{array}
\qquad\text{or}\qquad
\begin{array}{l}
AB = k\cdot A'B'\\
BC = k\cdot B'C' \\
CA = k\cdot C'A'
\end{array}
\]
\end{dfn}



\subsubsection{SAS-Similarity Theorem}







\begin{thm}[SAS-Similarity Theorem]
\index{Theorem!SAS Similarity}\index{SAS-Similarity Theorem} Knowing
the ratio of the lengths of two sides and the measure of the angle
between them, determines a triangle up to similarity. In pictures, we have something like:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/split1.pdf}
\]
\[
\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{AD}{AE} \qquad\Rightarrow\qquad \tri ABC \simeq \tri ADE.
\]
\end{thm}

\begin{ques} What does this mean, ``up to similarity?''
\end{ques}
\QM

Let's see if we (meaning you) can get to the bottom of why this
theorem is true. This time, you're going to produce the
illustrations. Use folding and tracing why not!

\begin{ques}
Fold any triangle. Now fold another triangle sharing one of the angles
so that the ratio of the lengths of the sides are the same in both
triangles. The sides touching the angle should share folds. You should
see some parallel lines. Which theorem above says that this should
happen?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} 
What do we know about parallel lines crossing another line?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} 
Can you sketch out (in words) how the questions above prove the SAS-Similarity
Theorem?
\end{ques}
\QM


\subsection{A Meaning of Multiplication}

Do you ever sit around asking yourself what different things
\textit{mean}? For example, ``What does being happy really mean?'' In
mathematics we don't dare try to tackle a brain-buster like that
one. Instead we try to focus on simple problems.

\begin{ques} What can multiplication mean? 
\end{ques}
\QM

I have no idea how you might have answered that question. Anyhow,
maybe you can answer the next questions:

\begin{ques} 
Can you give multiplication meaning involving groups of groups or
something of the sort?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} 
Can you give multiplication meaning involving areas or something of
the sort?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques}
Compare and contrast the two meanings of multiplication given above.
\end{ques}

OK---all of this is fine and good, but we one little problem. If
numbers by themselves ``mean'' lengths and numbers multiplied together
``mean'' areas, how do we do something like this:
\[
\underbrace{3}_\text{length} + \underbrace{4\cdot 5}_\text{area}?
\]


I say we can use similar triangles to save the day!


\begin{ques} 
Can you somehow give ``meaning'' to multiplication using similar
triangles? Hint: One of them should have a side of length $1$.

\subsection*{Problems for Section~\thesection}\hrule\vspace{1ex}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compare and contrast the ideas of \textit{equal triangles},
  \textit{congruent triangles}, and \textit{similar triangles}.
\item Explain why all equilateral triangles are similar to each other.
\item Explain why all isosceles right triangles are similar to each other. 
\item Explain why when given a right triangle, the altitude of the
  right angle divides the triangle into two smaller triangles each
  similar to the original right triangle.
\item The following sets contain lengths of sides of similar
  triangles. Solve for all unknowns---give all solutions. In each case
  explain your reasoning.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\{3,4,5\}$, $\{6,8,x\}$

\item $\{5,5,x\}$, $\{10,8,y\}$
\item $\{3,4,x\}$, $\{4,5,y\}$ 
\end{enumerate}
\item A \textit{Pythagorean Triple}\index{Pythagorean Triple} is a set
  of three positive integers $\{a,b,c\}$ such that $a^2 + b^2 =
  c^2$. Write down an infinite list of Pythagorean Triples. Explain
  your reasoning and justify all claims.
\item Here is a right triangle, note it is \textbf{not} drawn to
  scale:

Solve for all unknowns in the following cases.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $a = 3$, $b = ?$, $c = ?$, $d = 12$, $e = 5$, $f = ?$
\item $a = ?$, $b = 3$, $c = ?$, $d =8$, $e = 13$, $f = ?$

\end{enumerate}
In each case explain your reasoning.

\item Suppose you have two similar triangles. What can you say about
  the area of one in terms of the area of the other? Be specific and
  explain your reasoning.

\item During a solar eclipse we see that the apparent diameter of the
  Sun and Moon are nearly equal. If the Moon is around $240000$ miles
  from Earth, the Moon's diameter is about $2000$ miles, and the Sun's
  diameter is about $865000$ miles how far is the Sun from the Earth?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a relevant (and helpful) picture showing the important
  points of this problem.
\item Solve this problem, be sure to explain your reasoning.
\end{enumerate}


\item When jets fly above $8000$ meters in the air they form a vapor
  trail. Cruising altitude for a commercial airliner is around $10000$
  meters. One day I reached my arm into the sky and measured the
  length of the vapor trail with my hand---my hand could just span the
  entire trail. If my hand spans $9$ inches and my arm extends $25$
  inches from my eye, how long is the vapor trail? Explain your
  reasoning.

\item David proudly owns a 42 inch (measured diagonally) flat screen
  TV. Michael proudly owns a 13 inch (measured diagonally) flat screen
  TV. Dave sits comfortably with his dog Fritz at a distance of 10
  feet. How far must Michael stand from his TV to have the ``same''
  viewing experience?  Explain your reasoning.

\item You love IMAX movies. While the typical IMAX screen is 72 feet
  by 53 feet, your TV is only a 32 inch screen---it has a 32 inch
  diagonal. How close do you have to sit to your screen to simulate
  the IMAX format? Explain your reasoning.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a relevant (and helpful) picture showing the important
  points of this problem.

\item David proudly owns a 42 inch (measured diagonally) flat screen
  TV. Michael proudly owns a 13 inch (measured diagonally) flat screen
  TV. Michael stands and watches his TV at a distance of 2 feet. Dave
  sits comfortably with his dog Fritz at a distance of 10 feet. Whose
  TV appears bigger to the respective viewer? Explain your reasoning.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a relevant (and helpful) picture showing the important
  points of this problem.

\item Here is a personal problem: Suppose you are out somewhere and
  you see that when you stretch out your arm, the width of your thumb
  is the same apparent size as a distant object. How far away is the
  object if you know the object is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 6' long (as tall as a person).
\item 16' long (as long as a car).
\item 40' long (as long as a school bus).
\item 220' long (as long as a large passenger airplane).
\item 340' long (as long as an aircraft carrier).
\end{enumerate}
Explain your reasoning.

\item I was walking down Woody Hayes Drive, standing in front of
  St.\ John Arena when a car pulled up and the driver asked, ``Where
  is Ohio Stadium?'' At this point I was a bit perplexed, but
  nevertheless I answered, ``Do you see the enormous concrete building
  on the other side of the street that looks like the Roman Colosseum?
  That's it.''
 
The person in the car then asked, ``Where are the Twin-Towers then?''
Looking up, I realized that the towers were in fact just covered by
top of Ohio Stadium. I told the driver to just drive around the
stadium until they found two enormous identical towers---that would be
them. They thanked me and I suppose they met their destiny.

I am about 2 meters tall, I was standing about 100 meters from the
Ohio Stadium and Ohio Stadium is about 40 meters tall. If the Towers
are around 500 meters from the rotunda (the front entrance of the
stadium), how tall could they be and still be obscured by the stadium?
Explain your reasoning---for the record, the towers are about 80
meters tall.


\item Explain how to use the notion of similar triangles to multiply
  numbers with your answer expressed as a segment of the appropriate
  length.

%\item \label{P:CP} Given a circle centered at point $O$, we'll call
%  two points $P$ and $P'$ a \textit{connected pair} if:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item $O$, $P$, and $P'$ all lie on a line.
%\item $OP = \dfrac{1}{OP'}$.
%\end{enumerate}
%For example, if the radius of the circle was $12$ and $P$ was $6$
%units from $O$, then $P'$ would be $18$ units from $O$. Give some
%other examples of connected pairs.
%\item If $P$ and $P'$ are a connected pair (see Problem~\ref{P:CP})
%  and $P$ is on the circle, what can you say about $P'$? Explain your
%  reasoning.
%\item Consider the following diagram where $P$ and $P'$ are connected
%  pairs (see Problem~\ref{P:CP}):
%\[

%What is the distance $P'Q'$? Hint: Try to use the SAS-Similarity
%Theorem, to do this you'll have to find some sides with common ratios!
