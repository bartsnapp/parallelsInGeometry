\activity\section{Of Angles and Circles} %%remove * if added to notes!

In this handout we are going to look at pictures and see if we can
explain how they ``prove'' theorems.


\begin{thm} 
Any triangle inscribed in a circle having the diameter as a leg is a
right triangle.
\end{thm}

\begin{prob}
Can you tell me in English what this theorem says? Provide some
examples of this theorem in action.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
Here is a series of pictures, designed to be read from left to right.
\[

\]
Explain how these pictures ``prove'' the above theorem. In the process
of your explanation, you may need to label parts of the pictures and
do some algebra.
\end{prob}


\begin{thm} 
Given a chord of a circle, the central angle defined by this chord is
twice any inscribed angle defined by this chord.
\end{thm}

I'll play nice here and give you a picture of this theorem in action:
\[

\]

\begin{prob}
Can you tell me in English what this theorem says? For one thing, what
do the fancy words mean? Specifically, what is meant by
\textit{chord}, \textit{central angle}, and \textit{inscribed angle}?
\end{prob}

\begin{cor} 
Given a chord of a circle, all inscribed angles defined by this chord
are equal.
\end{cor}

\begin{prob} 
Firstly---what the heck is a corollary? Secondly---what is it saying?
Thirdly---why is it true?
\end{prob}
