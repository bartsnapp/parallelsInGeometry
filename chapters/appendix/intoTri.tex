\section{I'm Into Triangles}

In this activity, we're going to see if we can discover a simple
method for breaking \textit{every} polygon into triangles.

\begin{prob}
Draw yourself a polygon with at least 8 sides. Show how to break this
polygon into triangles.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
See if you can figure out exactly \textbf{what} your method was for
breaking the polygon into triangles. Write it down. 
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Find a casual acquaintance and declare ``I challenge you to present me
with a polygon that cannot be broken into triangles.'' Can you use
your method to break their polygon into triangles?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Draw a polygon that would be really difficult to break into triangles.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Come up with a simple method that will \textbf{always} work for
breaking a polygon into triangles. As a hint, draw a stick person in
your polygon, and try to imagine what they see\dots
\end{prob}
