Take you favorite group of symmetries of your favorite $n$-gon, call it $G$. Write out the group table. Got it? Good.

\begin{prob} Let $\mat{M}$ be an element of your group. Define
\[
C(\mat{M}) = \{\text{all elements of $G$ that commute with $\mat{M}$}\}
\]
For every element $\mat{M}$ of $G$, write out $C(\mat{M})$. Make some
observations.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Exactly which elements of $G$ commute with everything?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Repeat the exercises above for a different group.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Are the sets $C(\mat{M})$ groups themselves? Explain why or why not.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
For any given $\mat{M}$, what do you notice about the number of
elements found in $C(\mat{M})$?
\end{prob}
