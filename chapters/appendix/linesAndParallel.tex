\section{How Strange Could It Be?} 
                                               
In this activity, we are going to investigate just how strange a map
given by
\[
\mat{M} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b & c \\
d & e & f \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]
could possibly be.

\begin{prob}
Let $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\delta$ be real numbers, and let
$x$ be a variable. Consider the point:
\[
(\alpha x + \beta, \gamma x + \delta)
\]
Choose values for the Greek letters and plot this for varying values
of $x$. What sort of curve do you get?
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/complexPlane.pdf}
\]
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Now consider the line $y = mx + p$. Express its
coordinates \textit{without} using $y$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
Apply $\mat{M}$ to the coordinates you found above. What do you get? What
does this tell you about what happens to lines after you apply a
matrix to them?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Tell me some things about the line $y = mx + q$. 
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Apply  $\mat{M}$ to the coordinates associated to $y = mx + q$. What does this tell you about what happens to parallel lines after you apply a matrix to them?
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
What's going to happen to a parallelogram after you apply a matrix to
it?
\end{prob}
