We've mentioned several times that a parabola is the set of points
that are equidistant from a given point (the focus) and a given line
(the directrix):\index{focus}\index{directrix}
\[

\]
In this activity we are going to try an reconcile the definition given
above with the equation that you know and love (admit it!):
\[
y = ax^2 + bx + c
\]

\begin{prob}
How do we compute the distance between two points? Be explicit!
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Let the focus be the point $(0,1)$ and the directrix be the
$x$-axis. Find the formula for the given parabola.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Let the focus be the point $(0,1)$ and the directrix be the line
$y = -1$.  Find the formula for the given parabola.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Let the focus be the point $(1,1)$ and the directrix be the line $y =
-2$.  Find the formula for the given parabola.
\end{prob}
