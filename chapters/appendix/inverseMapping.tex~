Let $\mat{M}$ represent some mysterious matrix that maps the plane to itself.
So $\mat{M}$ is of the form:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b & c \\
d & e & f \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\begin{prob} 
If I tell you that 
\[
\mat{M}\vec{p} = 
\]
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
Draw a Venn diagram with two intersecting sets. List every possible
relationship between an element and these sets.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob} 
Draw a Venn diagram with three intersecting sets. List every possible
relationship between an element and these sets.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Describe and explain any patterns you see occurring.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}\label{P:AVD}
Draw a Venn diagram with four intersecting sets. List every possible
relationship between an element and these sets.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Are you \textbf{sure} that your diagram for Problem~\ref{P:AVD} is
correct? If so explain why. If not, draw a correct Venn diagram.
\end{prob}
