\section{Triangle Investigation}

\begin{prob}
Use informal reasoning to draw triangles based on the conditions given below.  You may use ruler, protractor, and/or compass if you wish, but your solutions should come from reflection and reasoning on you work.  In each part, determine whether the information provided determines a unique $\triangle ABC$, more than one triangle, or no triangle.\standard{7.G.2}   Note:  To check to see if two triangles are different, attempt to lay one directly on top of the other.  

\begin{enumerate}

\item $AB = 4$ and $BC = 5$
\item $m\angle CAB = 25^\circ$, $m\angle ABC = 75^\circ$, $m\angle BCA = 80^\circ$
\item $m\angle CAB = 25^\circ$, $m\angle ABC = 65^\circ$, $m\angle BCA = 80^\circ$
\item $AB = 5$, $m\angle BAC = 30^\circ$, $m\angle ABC = 45^\circ$
\item $AB = 5$, $BC = 4$, $m\angle ABC = 60^\circ$
\item $BC = 7$, $CA = 8$, $AB = 9$
\item $BC = 4$, $CA = 8$, $AB = 3$
\item $m\angle ABC = 45^\circ$, $BC = 8$, $CA = 12$
\item $m\angle ABC = 30^\circ$, $BC = 10$, $CA = 7$
\item $m\angle ABC = 60^\circ$, $BC = 10$, $CA = 3$

\end{enumerate}
