\section{Louie Llama and Regular Polygons} 

Louie Llama is a very curious llama.\index{Louie Llama} He knows that
each angle of a regular $3$-gon is $60^\circ$. He also knows that each
angle of a regular $4$-gon is $90^\circ$. But what he really wants to
know, are the measure of each angle of a regular $n$-gon. In this
activity we'll see if we can answer this question.


\begin{prob} 
Draw a picture of Louie Llama rotated $90^\circ$ counterclockwise.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
Draw a picture of Louie Llama rotated $180^\circ$ counterclockwise.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
Draw a picture of Louie Llama rotated $360^\circ$ counterclockwise.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} Sometimes Louie Llama likes to walk around lines he finds:
\[

\]
Through what angle did Louie Llama just rotate?
\end{prob}

Again, we're going to watch Louie Llama go for a walk. Draw yourself
any a regular $3$-gon. When Louie Llama walks around corners he
rotates. Check it out:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/llamaCorner.pdf}
\]
Since your $3$-gon is regular, each of its angles has measure
$\theta$. 
\begin{prob} 
Sketch Louie Llama walking around our $3$-gon. As he goes around a
corner, through what angle does Louie Llama rotate?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Find the measure of each angle of a $3$-gon. Explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Sketch a regular $4$-gon and find the measure of each angle of a
$4$-gon. Explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
Sketch a regular $5$-gon and find the measure of each angle of a
$5$-gon. Explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
Sketch a regular $6$-gon and find the measure of each angle of a
$6$-gon. Explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}


Now it is time to generalize!

\begin{prob}
Sketch a regular $n$-gon and find the measure of each angle of a
$n$-gon. Explain your reasoning. Note, your answer should be a formula.
\end{prob}
