\section{Morley's Miracle} %%remove * if added to notes!

Here is a construction that wasn't discovered until 1899. To make life
easier, I'm going to allow you to use the following (somewhat
imprecise) method for trisecting angles:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fold the paper so that the crease leads up to the
  angle, with the edge of the flap being folded-over bisecting the
  new angle of the crease and the edge that was not moved.
\item Now fold the edge that was not moved on top of the flap that was
  just made. It should fit perfectly near the angle. If done
  correctly, the steps above should trisect the angle.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{prob}
What does that say above? I know, I know, it sounds complicated. See
if you can figure it out anyhow.
\end{prob}

So now get your tracing paper out, make a big scalene triangle, and
trisect all three angles.

\begin{prob}
Connect adjacent trisectors. Do you see a miracle happening? (I know, I
know, if \textit{anybody} can follow these directions than we truly
will have a miracle on our hands!)
\end{prob}
