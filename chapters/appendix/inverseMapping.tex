Let $\mat{M}$ represent some mysterious matrix that maps the plane to itself.
So $\mat{M}$ is of the form:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b & c \\
d & e & f \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\begin{prob} 
If I tell you that $\vec{p} = (3,4)$ and 
\[
\mat{M}\vec{p} = \begin{bmatrix}2\\ 5\\ 1\end{bmatrix},
\]
give $3$ possible matrices for $\mat{M}$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
Now suppose that in addition to the fact above, I tell that
\[
\mat{M}\vec{o} = \begin{bmatrix}-2\\ 0\\ 1\end{bmatrix},
\]
where $\vec{o}$ is the origin.  Give $3$ possible matrices for
$\mat{M}$.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob} 
Now suppose that in addition to the two facts above, I tell you that 
\[
\mat{M}\vec{q} = \begin{bmatrix}-1\\ 1\\ 1\end{bmatrix},
\]
where $\vec{q} = (1,1)$.  How many possibilities do you have for
$\mat{M}$ now? What are they?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Here is a picture of my buddy \textit{Sticky}:
\[

\]
As you can see, he's been dancing with some matrix $\mat{M}$. Can you
tell me which matrix it was? What are good points to pay attention to?
\end{prob}
