In this activity, we try to understand what the ``act of measuring is'' a
quantity. In particular, we will try to draw out common measurement ...

\begin{prob} 
2. What are standard units that people typically use when measuring
length, area, and volume?  Are they related to one another in some
way(s)?  What other kind of units could be used to measure, say, area?
Why might they be less “popular”?
\end{prob}



\begin{prob}
When we measure the ``amount quantity'' of a set of apples, the
``amount'' measurement is done with the unit being the type of object
the set consists of.  Why can't we do that when measuring length,
area, volume, time, weight, or angle?  What do we do instead?
\end{prob}
