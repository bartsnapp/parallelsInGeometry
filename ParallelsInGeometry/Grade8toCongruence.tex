\section{Grade 8}
In school mathematics, transformations and symmetry have typically been small niche topics, separate from each other, separate from most of the rest of school mathematics, and receiving little curricular attention.  Congruence, on the other hand, is a more prominent idea that begins informally in the elementary grades as ``same shape, same size'' and culminates in high school with axioms, theorems, and proofs.  

Understand congruence and similarity using physical models, transparencies, or geometry software.

\section{High School Geometry}
In school mathematics, transformations and symmetry have typically been small niche topics, separate from each other, separate from most of the rest of school mathematics, and receiving little curricular attention.  Congruence, on the other hand, is a more prominent idea that begins informally in the elementary grades as ``same shape, same size'' and culminates in high school with axioms, theorems, and proofs.
