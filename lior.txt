NEW RULES
1) Given a point, a new point can be placed by marking through folded,
or multiple sheets of, paper.

2) Given points p,q, one can mark a line containing p and q. Hence
given a line, a new line can be placed by tracing through folded, or
two sheets of, paper.

3) Given two intersecting lines, one can mark a point on the intersection.

4) Given two intersecting lines l,m and two points p, q, one can fold
a line placing p onto l and q onto m.

5) Given points p,q, one can fold a line placing p onto q.




NEW QUES
1) simply decide if a given line intersects a given parabola

2) find the intersection of a horizontal line with a parabola x^2. 
Basically, you start with any old directrix and focus and call that 
curve y=x^2. A horizontal line is y=c for some c. I guess figuring out c 
is part of the problem. One should compare the coordinate definition of 
a parabola with the focus-directrix definition. Then it's a matter of 
constructing the square root of c. That is easy enough with compass and 
straight edge. I think it's also easy with origami.
